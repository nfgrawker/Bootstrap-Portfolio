          <p>I grew up in small town Minnesota with spurts in Tampa, Florida. Computers were a hobby of mine since a young age. Growing up I coded basic games, tinkered with electronics and built rockets.</p>
          <p>In college I grew away from computers and technology as I learned to dissect people and their minds. I majored in Psychology and spent the better part of 10 years working with intense psychiatric illness and chemical dependency. This was hard and enduring work, which led me to becoming burnt out and needing a refuge from psychology. I transitioned to the world of Real Estate and became a Realtor <img src="./assets/images/realtorlogo.jpg" alt="Realtor Logo" style="width:20px; height:20px">.</p>
          <p>As I continued in Real Estate I realized that it was just another form of Mental Health Counseling. The house sale is the single biggest purchase 95% of people will make in their lifetimes. Considering this it is no surprise that the sale of a house becomes such a stressor which lead many to need emotional support during this time. More and more I came to realize that this field was draining me in the same way as my previous career. Yet, I did not want to give up completely. I began to see many ways in which Real Estate was behind in technology and along with the help of a friend of mine I began to code. First in Python, then SQL, onto HTML and now into CSS. Every day I feel more energy and feel like I found something I am naturally inclined towards that also gives me energy. Check out my portfolio or contact me to see more of my journey. I hope my code will bring you as much joy as it brings me and maybe it will even impress you. </p>
